# CONCLUDE


This repository includes the code for running the CONCLUDE model, integrating the impacts of sea-level rise and adaptation policies on spatial population distributions from 2020 to 2100. We provide four different code versions, depending on the adaptation policy scenarios and socioeconomic, and sea-level rise scenarios (i.e. nA, wA; SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP3-RCP4.5, SSP5-RCP8.5)run:

pop_proj_nA = integration of submergence due to sea-level rise without adaptation policies; applicable to all SSP-RCP combinations

pop_proj_wA_ssp1-rcp26 = integration of frequently flooded areas in unprotected locations as retreat zones; dynamic setback zones in occasionally flooded locations plus coastal wetlands and coastline buffer (i.e. population potential = 0)

pop_proj_wA_ssp3-rcp45 = integration of submergence due to sea-level rise in unprotected locations

pop_proj_wA_ssp5-rcp85 = integration of submergence due to sea-level rise in unprotected locations; static setback zones based on coastline buffer (i.e. population potential = 0)

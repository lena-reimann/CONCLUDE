# CONCLUDE

This repository includes the code for running the CONCLUDE model, integrating the impacts of sea-level rise and adaptation policies on spatial population distributions from 2020 to 2100. The code provided can be applied to three SSP-RCP combinations (i.e. SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP3-RCP4.5, SSP5-RCP8.5) and two adaptation policy scenarios (i.e. nA, wA).

# CONCLUDE



 
No SLR (nSLR) 
?	Produce population projections from 2020 to 2100 for each cntr and each scenario 
?	Use population numbers (urb/rur/tot) per cntr from the SSPs

With SLR (wSLR) 
?	No adaptation (nA) o Load inundation layers 
 ‘Pick up’ population in submerged areas + set spatial mask to 0 o Redistribute population picked up along with population allocation 
? 	With adaptation (wA) o Load inundation layers (accounting for protected land + retreat (SSP1 only)) 
o ‘Pick up’ population in submerged areas + set spatial mask to 0 o Use new spatial mask including setback zones (in SSPs 1 + 5) o Redistribute population picked up along with population alloca
